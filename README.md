# Exam-Scheduler

## Introduction: 
The Exam Scheduling System is a project aimed at addressing the complex task of generating optimized examination timetables for universities. The process of creating exam schedules involves considering numerous constraints, such as ensuring fairness for students, accommodating teachers' availability, avoiding exam overlaps, and adhering to specific time slots and room allocations. Manual scheduling of exams is time-consuming and prone to errors, necessitating an automated solution to streamline the process. Effective exam scheduling is a crucial task for educational institutions, as it ensures a smooth and fair examination process for students, optimizes resource utilization, and minimizes conflicts. Our exam scheduling system offers a robust solution to automate and streamline this complex process.

## Aim: 
The aim of the Exam Scheduling System is to develop a generic solution that automates the process of generating optimized examination timetables for universities. The system must adhere to various hard and soft constraints, ensuring fairness, efficiency, and convenience for students, teachers, and administrators involved in the exam scheduling process.

## Objectives:
The objectives of the Exam Scheduling System are as follows:
•	Develop an algorithm to generate exam schedules considering hard and soft constraints.
•	Implement a local search algorithm to optimize the generated schedules.
•	Create a user-friendly interface for inputting and displaying exam schedule information.
•	Evaluate the solution based on fulfilled constraints and overall fitness of the schedule.
•	Provide a comprehensive documentation outlining the project's design, implementation, and findings.

## Problem Statement: 
The problem addressed by the Exam Scheduling System is the manual and time-consuming process of creating exam timetables for universities. The system aims to automate this process by generating optimized schedules that adhere to various constraints, such as scheduling exams for each course, avoiding exam overlaps for students, ensuring teachers' availability, and considering preferences like breaks and course sequencing.

## Requirements: 
•	Input: The system requires datasets containing information about teachers, students, rooms, courses, and registered courses for each student. The data will be provided in Excel files.
•	Constraints: The system must adhere to hard constraints, such as scheduling exams for each course, avoiding exam overlaps for students, and ensuring teachers' availability. Soft constraints, such as breaks and course sequencing, should also be considered.
•	Local Search Algorithm: The system should implement a suitable local search algorithm to optimize the generated schedules.
•	User Interface: The system should provide a user-friendly interface for displaying the exam schedule, and showcasing fulfilled constraints.

## Methodology: 
•	Data Preparation: The system collects and preprocesses the input datasets containing information about teachers, students, rooms, courses, and registered courses.
•	Constraint Evaluation: The system evaluates the hard constraints, such as ensuring each course has an exam, avoiding exam overlaps for students, and meeting time and invigilation constraints.
•	Local Search Algorithm: The system applies a suitable local search algorithm to optimize the generated schedules by iteratively adjusting the exam time slots and room assignments.
•	Soft Constraint Consideration: The system incorporates soft constraints, such as breaks and course sequencing, to improve the overall quality of the exam schedules.
•	User Interface Development: The system develops a user-friendly interface for users to view the generated exam schedules, and analyze the fulfilled constraints..

## Conclusion: 
The Exam Scheduling System provides a robust solution to the challenging task of generating optimized exam schedules for universities. By employing a local search algorithm and considering various hard and soft constraints, the system automates the process, ensuring fairness, efficiency, and convenience for all stakeholders. The system's user-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation further enhance its usability and understanding. Overall, the Exam Scheduling System streamlines the exam scheduling process, leading to improved academic operations within universities.
